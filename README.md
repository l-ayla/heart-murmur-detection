# ðŸ«€ Heart Murmur Detection with Deep Learning

This streamlit applet is a simple front end to a short project exploring deep learning optimisation for heart murmur detection, it is based on the [2022 George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge](https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2022/), for which the database on which it is trained can be installed 
```
wget -r -N -c -np https://physionet.org/files/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/
```
This applet is available to use [here](murmur-detection.streamlit.app)


### How it works 
1. #### Upload File
Upload a ```.wav``` file of a heart recording (minimum 9 seconds for baseline accuracy)

2. #### View Segment 
The uploaded file is then preprocessed and converted into a 128-Mel-Feature Spectrogram to be optionally viewed
   

2. #### Analyse 
The ```pcg.h5``` classifies the file as one of three classes 
- Murmur Present
- Murmur Absent
- Unknown 

###### (Any recording with less than 50% confidence is re-classified as unknown automatically)

### CNN Model 
![final](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45bfb427-d9b1-4405-8dae-5192fa5dd962)

Trained with AdamW over 100 epochs, with an initial learning rate of 1e-3, which halved in the 50th epoch to 5e-4 and decreased five fold in the 80th epoch to 1e-4. Trained using 80/20 patient-wise stratified split.
